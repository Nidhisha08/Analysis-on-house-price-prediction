# Analysis-on-house-price-prediction
This is the data detailing information about the house and its rental cost. In this project,
I conducted data analysis to identify the influencing factors on the rental price of the house.
I utilized regression analysis to understand the relationship between these factors and the dependent
variable, which is the rent price of the house.
